Installation
============

These are the basic steps to install and run the application locally on a Linux
system. There are more detailed instructions, other deployment options as well
as an administration guide available at https://wger.readthedocs.io or locally
in your code repository in the docs folder.

Please consult the commands' help for further information and available
parameters.


Docker
------

Useful to just try it out. Check the documentation on how to use the wger/devel
docker image or the docker-compose file for development::

    docker run -ti --name wger.apache --publish 8000:80 wger/apache

Then just open http://localhost:8000 and log in as: **admin**, password **admin**


Development version (from git)
------------------------------

**Note:** You can safely install from master, it is almost always in a usable
and stable state.


1) Install the necessary packages

::

 $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev nodejs npm git
 $ sudo npm install -g yarn sass


Then install the python packages from pypi in the virtualenv::

 $ python3 -m venv venv-wger
 $ source venv-wger/bin/activate


2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries
   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.

::

 $ git clone https://github.com/wger-project/wger.git
 $ cd wger
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 $ python setup.py develop
 $ wger create-settings --settings-path $(pwd)/settings.py --database-path $(pwd)/database.sqlite
 $ wger bootstrap --settings-path $(pwd)/settings.py --no-start-server
 $ python manage.py runserver

3) Log in as: **admin**, password **admin**

After the first run you just start django's development server::

 $ python manage.py runserver

2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries
   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.
